# gulp minimum task

## A simple, easy to understand gulp task for biginners.  
This is made by me from scratch in order to demonstrate how to handle a gulp task. This allows you to ONLY live reload HTML files that you are editing. As a starting point, this task is simple and easy enough. Once you get accustomed with gulp manners, you can develop this more usable.
